# 1. Introduction
I've always struggled to make sense of the diverse ways we come to know and understand the world. Initially, it seemed straightforward: I wanted to grasp why different fields, from physics to ethics, rely on distinct methods yet each claims its own form of objectivity. But explanations I found often felt clumsy or incomplete. I was equally concerned with how we understand consciousness in a way that respects its irreducible, subjective nature while still acknowledging biological and scientific roots.

This framework aims to show how and why objectivity—though it references different aspects of reality—actually emerges as a construction in Layer 4. By distinguishing among four layers of reality and knowledge, we can see why physics, biology, ethics, and other fields each have a legitimate but distinct route to "objectivity." This approach doesn't attempt to "solve" consciousness or "prove" moral realism; rather, it provides a map showing how different disciplines anchor their knowledge claims in different layers yet converge in Layer 4 to build objective knowledge.

The framework distinguishes between four fundamental layers:

Layer 1 (Physical Foundation): The mind-independent physical reality of matter, energy, and forces
Layer 2 (Perceptual Filter): The biological mechanisms through which organisms process information
Layer 3 (Subjective Stream): The domain of first-person qualitative conscious experience
Layer 4 (Epistemic Constructs): The conceptual frameworks we create for investigating and labeling truth and objectivity

Each layer represents a fundamental aspect of reality and our engagement with it. Together, they form a coherent picture of how we experience and understand the world. While philosophers have developed various ontological frameworks, this one is designed specifically as a practical tool for understanding knowledge differences.

Thicker arrows point upward from lower to higher layers, indicating stronger dependency relationships. Layer 1 (Physical Foundation) at bottom, Layer 2 (Perceptual Filter) above it, Layer 3 (Subjective Stream) next, and Layer 4 (Epistemic Constructs) at top. Labels indicate key characteristics of each layer.]
