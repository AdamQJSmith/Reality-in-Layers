# Domains of Inquiry

A framework for understanding how different fields achieve objectivity through distinct types of evidence and methodological approaches.

## Overview

This project explores why physics, ethics, aesthetics, and other fields use radically different methods while each legitimately claiming to produce objective knowledge. The framework identifies four domains of inquiry, each requiring different standards of rigor appropriate to the type of evidence being examined.

## The Four Domains

1. **Physical (D1)**: Mind-independent matter, energy, and physical law
2. **Interactive (D2)**: Systems that detect and respond to environmental stimuli, enabling and shaping consciousness
3. **Experiential (D3)**: First-person conscious experience, serving as primary evidence for fields like ethics and aesthetics
4. **Constructs (D4)**: Collectively-held frameworks including language, logic, theories, and norms

## Key Insight

Objectivity is domain-relative. Different domains require different methodological approaches, and this methodological pluralism reflects the diverse character of evidence across human inquiry.

## Repository Structure

- **Third Draft/**: Current working version incorporating epistemological framing
- **Second Draft/**: Previous version with ontological emphasis
- **First Draft/**: Initial domain-based model
- **Initial Notes/**: Foundational concepts and early exploration

## Status

Active development. The framework continues to evolve through refinement of core concepts and clarification of methodological relationships between domains.
