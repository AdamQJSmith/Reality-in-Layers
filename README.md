# Reality-in-Layers: The Goal is Elegant Clarity

## The "Why" of This Project

This project does not aim to invent new philosophical categories. The ideas of thinkers like John Searle (on ontological vs. epistemic reality) and Karl Popper (on his "three worlds") are powerful and robust. However, these academic frameworks can often feel dense and clumsy when used as practical tools for communication. They solve the problem, but not always elegantly.

The goal of this project is different. It is to create a framework that prioritizes **elegance and utility** over exhaustive philosophical rigor.

## Our Contribution: A Practical Map

This framework is intended to be a simple, clean "workbench diagram" that allows people from different fields to have a more productive conversation. It's a map that achieves its goal by helping users:

1.  **Locate the Domain:** Quickly identify whether a claim is primarily rooted in the Physical, Biological, Subjective, or Intersubjective domain.
2.  **Understand the Filters:** Recognize how our access to one domain is necessarily filtered by the others (e.g., our biology filters the physical, our consciousness filters our biology).
3.  **Respect the Process:** Appreciate that all claims, regardless of their source domain, must pass through the same "Epistemic Arena" of logic, scrutiny, and consensus-building to become objective knowledge.
