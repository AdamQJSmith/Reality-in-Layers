## 4  What Counts as a Layer?

The word *layer* is doing technical work in this framework. It does **not** mean a mere topic area or level of description; it marks a domain that

1. possesses properties that cannot be fully captured in the vocabulary of the layer below,
2. depends on lower layers for its existence, and
3. contributes a distinctive type of evidence when claims move toward the Layer 4 validation gate.

Table 1 sketches the key contrasts. The short subsections that follow give each row enough detail to stand on its own.

### Table 1  Four irreducible layers and their evidence handles

| Layer                      | Ontological status                  | Core properties                                 | Typical data                                 | Everyday example               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **L1 Physical foundation** | Exists without observers            | Law‑governed, measurable, spatiotemporal        | Mass, charge, wavelength, acceleration       | Dropping a ball                |
| **L2 Living layer**        | Emergent from L1, goal‑directed     | Homeostasis, metabolism, sensory coding         | fMRI, EEG, reflex latency, hormone levels    | Pupil dilation in bright light |
| **L3 Subjective stream**   | Emergent from L2, first‑person only | Qualitative feel, unity, temporal flow, valence | Pain reports, flavour rankings, mood diaries | The sharp sting of a paper cut |
| **L4 Epistemic arena**     | Constructed, publicly testable      | Language, logic, statistics, norms              | Proofs, peer‑reviewed papers, legal rulings  | The periodic table             |

### 4.1 Layer 1 – Physical foundation

Layer 1 is the basal fabric of matter and energy. Its contents behave according to regularities expressible in mathematics and detectable with instruments. Because these entities do not rely on living observers, their existence is ontologically objective in the strictest sense. Evidence handles here are readings that any competent operator should reproduce: kilogram masses, nanometre wavelengths, millisecond decay times. Limitations lie in calibration error, theory‑laden observation, and scale access (we cannot hold a quark in tweezers). Still, no explanatory story can wholly ignore Layer 1, because every higher process runs on physical substrate.

### 4.2 Layer 2 – Living layer

Life reorganises Layer 1 matter into systems that preserve themselves, seek resources, and react adaptively. Within those systems, specialised sensory–neural circuits convert external events into coded signals. These codes are **necessary** for consciousness but not yet consciousness itself. Evidence handles include behavioural assays, imaging techniques such as fMRI and EEG, lesion studies, and cross‑species comparisons. The main reliability challenge is species‑specific bias: the human visual system glimpses only a sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum, bats hear ultrasounds we cannot, and so on. Layer 2 explains why an identical physical stimulus can matter differently to different organisms.

### 4.3 Layer 3 – Subjective stream

When Layer 2 activity crosses a still‑unmapped threshold, it yields lived experience: colour, pain, desire, boredom, déjà vu. These phenomena are ontologically subjective because their very existence is tied to being felt. Yet they are not private in the sense of being incommunicable—people compare notes and achieve enough overlap to build psychophysics and aesthetics. The evidence handle is first‑person report, refined by intersubjective checks such as blinded tasting panels or phenomenological interview protocols. Perspective bias is unavoidable, so Layer 3 claims lean heavily on convergence across many observers rather than single measurements.

### 4.4 Layer 4 – Epistemic arena

Layer 4 is where raw readings, neural traces, and lived experiences become *claims*. Communities craft languages, logical systems, statistical tests, moral arguments, and legal standards, then subject candidate statements to those tools. A gravitational equation, a clinical diagnostic manual, and a constitutional clause all live here. Because Layer 4 is constructed, its objects are abstract—but they are not arbitrary. They survive only if they cohere internally and align with the best evidence handles available from Layers 1‑3.

### 4.5 Dependence and feedback

Dependence is asymmetric: each higher layer needs the one below for its existence, yet cannot be fully reduced to it. At the same time feedback is real. Layer 4 theories spawn microscopes that extend Layer 2 perception and particle accelerators that reshape Layer 1 matter. Layer 3 intentions move Layer 2 muscles, which shift Layer 1 objects. Recognising both direction arrows avoids the twin errors of pure reductionism and pure constructivism.

With the layers defined, we can now examine how different fields of study combine these evidence handles on their way through the single validation gate.
