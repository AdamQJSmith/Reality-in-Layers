\## Appendix C  Historical Side Notes

\### C.1 Newton on Colour (1672)
Newton’s prism experiments separated L1 wavelengths and built the first systematic Layer 4 colour theory. He treated hue as a physical property, sidestepping L2 and L3. The modern framework shows why later scientists had to fold in cone biology (L2) and phenomenology (L3) to complete the story.

\### C.2 Adam Smith on Value (1776)
Smith distinguished “value in use” and “value in exchange,” an early recognition that economic worth depends on L3 motives as well as L1 resources. Later marginalists formalised utility curves (Layer 4), implicitly integrating L2 consumption behaviour and L3 preference.

\### C.3 Gödel and Hilbert on Mathematical Objectivity (1930s)
Hilbert sought certainty through formal proof systems (pure Layer 4). Gödel’s incompleteness theorems showed that no consistent system can prove all truths about itself, exposing an intrinsic limit inside the Layer 4 arena that no appeal to lower layers can repair.

These snapshots illustrate a pattern: intellectual progress often begins by privileging one layer, then matures by integrating the others through better toolkits and stricter gate tests.
