## Appendix A The Hard Problem of Consciousness

### A.1 Statement of the problem
David Chalmers coined "the hard problem" to mark the explanatory gap between **functional accounts of neural activity** (Layer 2) and **felt experience** (Layer 3). Why should the right spike pattern ever *feel* like anything at all?

### A.2 Where the four‑layer map helps

* **Location, not solution** – The framework simply parks the gap between L2 and L3 so that research on knowledge formation can proceed without first closing it.
* **Bias audit** – Because L3 data carry high perspective bias, any proposed reduction must clear far heavier coherence and convergence tests at Layer 4 than ordinary L2‑only claims.
* **Predictive guide** – If a theory one day bridges the gap, it will show measurable correlations that let investigators *predict specific qualia* from L2 patterns across subjects, satisfying the Layer 4 requirement of reproducible convergence.

### A.3 Live research routes

1. **Integrated information** hypotheses – quantify consciousness with network metrics; still debated because metric choice changes results.
2. **Higher‑order thought** models – place consciousness in metacognitive loops; challenge lies in operationalising "aboutness" without circularity.
3. **Neuro‑phenomenology** – combine EEG with disciplined first‑person reports; promising but labor‑intensive and culturally sensitive.

Until one of these routes wins the Layer 4 contest, the framework remains agnostic: L3 is treated as a real but currently irreducible box.
