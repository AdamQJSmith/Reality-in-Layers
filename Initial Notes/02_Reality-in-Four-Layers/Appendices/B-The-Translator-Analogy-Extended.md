\## Appendix B  The Translator Analogy – Extended

| Feature           | Human fluent speaker                               | Large language model                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layer span**    | Operates across L1‑L4, with live L3 experience     | Operates between L1 silicon states and L4 text patterns; no L3 |
| **Semantics**     | Grounded: words evoke sensory memory and affect    | Derivative: statistical echo of prior texts                    |
| **Novel coinage** | Can invent a term on the spot to fill a felt gap   | Can mash existing tokens but cannot *feel* the gap             |
| **Error signal**  | Embarrassment, boredom, aesthetic displeasure (L3) | Token‑probability mismatch, loss gradients (L1)                |

**Implication** Current AI can accelerate Layer 4 drafting but cannot originate meanings that require new Layer 3 insight. A future system with bona fide experience would need its own bias profile and gate tests, a prospect raised in §10.3 open question 2.
