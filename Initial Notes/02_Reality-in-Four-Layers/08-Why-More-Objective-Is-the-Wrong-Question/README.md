## 8 Why "More Objective" Is the Wrong Question

Calling one discipline "more objective" than another implies a single ladder of rigor with physics at the top and fields like ethics or macro-economics near the bottom. The four-layer framework shows that this picture is misleading. Objectivity is **mode-specific**, not scalar. Each field earns the badge by solving a different evidential problem with a toolkit tuned to its primary handle.

### 8.1 Three contrasting paths to the validation gate

| Field (cluster)                         | Starting handle                                                             | Dominant gate tests                                                  | Typical failure case                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physics** (Physical sciences)         | Layer 1 measurements with low noise                                         | Precise quantitative prediction; blind replication                   | A single out-of-range data point can refute a model               |
| **Ethics** (Normative fields)           | Layer 3 moral intuitions heavily burdened by perspective bias               | Coherence across cases; reflective equilibrium; historical stability | Internal contradiction or persistent, informed moral disagreement |
| **Macroeconomics** (Normative & social) | Mixed handle: Layer 3 expectations + Layer 2 aggregates + Layer 1 resources | Out-of-sample forecast accuracy; policy robustness                   | Parameter drift or policy that destabilises inflation             |

*Physics* can set a 5-sigma falsification bar because the signal-to-noise ratio of its handle is high. *Ethics* cannot rely on that bar; instead it filters moral judgments through consistency pressures ("Would I will this maxim universally?") and wide reflective testing across cultures and eras. *Macroeconomics* sits between: its models succeed only if they both cohere conceptually *and* reduce forecast error when implemented.

### 8.2 Error profile, not prestige, sets the bar

The higher the built-in bias of a handle, the heavier the compensating tests at the gate:

* **Low-bias handle (L1)** → high-precision rejection thresholds.
* **Moderate-bias handle (L2)** → replication plus convergence across methods.
* **High-bias handle (L3)** → multi-layer triangulation, coherence, and long-run reflective checks.

A field that begins with heavy Layer 3 data is **not** sloppy if it cannot achieve nanometre precision; it is simply compensating for a harder evidential starting point.

### 8.3 When disputes really are about rigor

Charges of "softness" or "hardness" are warranted only when a field fails to apply the right compensating tests for its handle:

* If an ethical theory ignores clear counter-examples, it has skipped the coherence test; its objectivity claim collapses.
* If a physics paper buries a calibration drift, it fails its low-noise obligation; it forfeits objectivity in its own mode.
* If a macro model retro-fits parameters after each crisis, it abuses ex-post adjustment; predictive credentials evaporate.

The framework therefore rescues the concept of objectivity while sharpening our sense of malpractice.

### 8.4 Practical payoff

* **Interdisciplinary dialogue** – Instead of trading insults about rigor, collaborators can spell out: "Our starting handle is Layer 3, so we weight reflective equilibrium heavily; yours is Layer 1, so you weight replication. Let us design hybrid standards."
* **Curriculum design** – Educators can teach students why methods shift across departments without implying a value hierarchy.
* **Peer review** – Journals can ask referees to check whether the submitted work uses the gate tests appropriate to its handle, rather than forcing every paper into a physics-style template.

Objectivity remains a single badge, but the inspection criteria stamped on it vary with the material presented. The next section explores further implications of this insight for AI research, research design, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
