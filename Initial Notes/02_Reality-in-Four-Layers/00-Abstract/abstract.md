# Abstract

Confusion about what counts as objective or subjective keeps science, the humanities, and public debate talking past one another. This paper offers a four‑layer map that shows both the sources of evidence and the single arena in which every claim must be judged. Layer 1 is mind‑independent physical reality. Layer 2 is the living layer – the entire biological system that sustains an organism and, in one of its subsystems, converts external signals into the sensory codes required for consciousness. Layer 3 is the first‑person stream of experience. Layer 4 is the arena of epistemic constructs where, through collective agreement and consensus, communities craft theories, proofs, and norms. Physical sciences grip Layer 1, biological sciences are contained in Layer 2, and personal experiences explain Layer 3; and the moral, ethical, or aesthetic claims that grow from it. And all findings are finally tested against Layer 4's standards of coherence, logic, and mutual shared scrutiny. By separating the evidential handles supplied by Layers 1‑3 from the validation standards imposed in Layer 4, the framework removes the ambiguity around objectivity and clears a path for more constructive cross‑disciplinary dialogue.
