## 7  Three Worked Examples

The framework now meets reality. Each case below follows the same path:

> **Layer trace** L1 context → L2 mechanisms → L3 experience or motive → L4 construct and validation

### 7.1 Colour – a textbook L1‑to‑L4 chain

| Layer  | What happens                                                                                                                                               | Evidence handle                                   | How the claim becomes objective                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1** | Sunlight contains wavelengths 400‑700 nm. Surfaces absorb some, reflect others.                                                                            | Spectrophotometer readings                        | Calibration against standard wavelength sources                   |
| **L2** | Three cone types convert reflected light into neural spike codes.                                                                                          | fMRI of visual cortex, single‑cell recordings     | Reproducible retinotopic maps across observers                    |
| **L3** | Observers report the qualitative feel of “red,” “blue,” “pinkish‑orange.”                                                                                  | Psychophysical colour‑matching tasks, hue scaling | Intersubjective convergence on CIE colour space                   |
| **L4** | Physics defines wavelength, biology defines cone sensitivities, psychology defines perceptual opponent axes, industry adopts the Pantone or sRGB standard. | Mathematical mapping tables, ISO colour profiles  | Device‑independent colour reproduction passes blind visual checks |

Take‑away: debates over whether colour is “in the world” or “in the head” dissolve once we see that each statement is anchored in a different layer and tested by the appropriate handle.

### 7.2 Clinical depression – merging L2 biology and L3 distress at the gate

| Layer  | What happens                                                                                 | Evidence handle                                    | How the claim becomes objective                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1** | Pharmacological compounds modulate monoamine levels.                                         | High‑performance liquid chromatography             | Dose–response curves                                     |
| **L2** | Dysregulated neural circuits in limbic and prefrontal regions.                               | Resting‑state fMRI, EEG alpha asymmetry            | Statistical group differences vs controls                |
| **L3** | Persistent sadness, anhedonia, suicidality.                                                  | Structured‑clinical‑interviews, daily mood diaries | Inter‑rater reliability and longitudinal stability       |
| **L4** | DSM‑5 or ICD‑11 criteria integrate neural findings, symptom duration, functional impairment. | Field trials, meta‑analysis, peer review           | Predictive validity for treatment response and prognosis |

Take‑away: a diagnosis is neither a pure brain state nor a mere feeling. It is a Layer 4 construct that earns objectivity by jointly tracking L2 biomarkers and L3 reports, then surviving reliability and outcome tests.

### 7.3 Inflation and monetary policy – an L3‑heavy construct tethered to lower layers

| Layer  | What happens                                                                                                                | Evidence handle                                                             | How the claim becomes objective                                  |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1** | Physical goods and services require raw materials, energy, labour hours.                                                    | Commodity price indices, production output stats                            | Audited national accounts                                        |
| **L2** | Populations adjust spending and saving based on income and expectations.                                                    | Household expenditure surveys, labour‑force data                            | Reproducible sampling methodology                                |
| **L3** | Trust, fear, and future expectations shape willingness to hold currency.                                                    | Consumer‑confidence indices, business‑sentiment polls                       | Cross‑survey convergence, predictive track record                |
| **L4** | Central banks model inflation using CPI, output gap, expectation measures, then set interest rates or reserve requirements. | Econometric models vetted by out‑of‑sample forecasting, policy back‑testing | Reduced forecast error and improved stability vs counterfactuals |

Take‑away: the “value” of money rests on L3 belief but is continuously checked against L1 resource constraints and L2 behavioural aggregates. Objectivity lies in model coherence and predictive batting average, not in a timeless physical property.

### 7.4 What the trio shows

* One framework scales from photons to pharmaceuticals to prices.
* The tougher the error profile of the starting handle, the more Layer 4 must lean on coherence and longitudinal testing.
* No case validates the idea that some fields lack objectivity; they simply build it with different materials.

With concrete examples in view, we can now address the lingering intuition that physics is “hard” while ethics or macro‑economics is “soft.”
