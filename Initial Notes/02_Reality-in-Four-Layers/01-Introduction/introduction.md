# Introduction
Objectivity is an ordinary word that hides several distinct jobs. A physicist appeals to it when defending a mass measurement, a neuroscientist when calibrating a brain‑imaging protocol, a literary critic when citing shared interpretive standards, and a citizen when arguing about justice. Each speaker presents a different kind of evidence, yet each claims the same badge. The result is chronic cross‑talk: facts versus feelings, science versus humanities, numbers versus narratives. By distinguishing four layers of reality and knowledge, the framework shows why physics, biology, ethics, and other fields each reach objectivity by distinct routes. It also reveals exactly where evidence originates and where every claim is finally judged.
## 1.1 One validation gate, many evidence handles
Every claim, from the mass of an electron to the justice of a new law, must clear the same high bar before it earns the status of knowledge. That bar sits in what I call Layer 4 – the zone of epistemic constructs. Here communities agree upon shared procedures: logic, replication, peer review, reflective equilibrium, and other rules that let any competent inquirer reach the same verdict in principle. What differs across subject matters is not the gate itself but the evidence handle that the claimant can grab when approaching it.
Layer 1 is the physical foundation: particles, fields, energies, and the structures they form. No life is required for these entities to exist or interact.
Layer 2 is the living layer. It covers the entire biological system that keeps an organism alive, including the specialised sensory–neural circuits that convert external events into coded signals that can support consciousness.
Layer 3 is the subjective stream: the felt qualities of seeing scarlet, hearing middle C, tasting bitterness, feeling pain or anticipation, and later recalling any of these. These first‑person occurrences are immediately known to the subject but never appear directly on an instrument dial.
Layer 4 is the arena of epistemic constructs: language, axioms, statistical tests, moral arguments, peer review. Nothing here is raw fact or raw feeling; everything is a constructed claim submitted to public reason.
These layers correspond to distinct evidence handles. Layer 1 relies on direct empirical observation—instrument readings and repeatable measurements. Layer 2 draws on behavioural assays, cross‑species studies, fMRI, EEG, and lesion mapping—research that still relies on Layer 1 instruments for data capture. Layer 3 grounds itself in first‑person reports and their intersubjective convergence. Each approach faces distinct limitations: calibration error for Layer 1, species‑specific bias for Layer 2, perspective bias for Layer 3. Yet all findings must ultimately satisfy the same Layer 4 requirements of logical coherence and rational consensus to qualify as objective knowledge.
Recognising this single validation process dissolves the urge to rank disciplines by purity. Physics is not “more objective” because it owns better rules; it simply starts with a handle less burdened by perspective from Layer 1. Ethics is not “merely subjective”; it starts with a handle saturated with first‑person data and therefore leans harder on reflective equilibrium and historical comparison of Layer 3. Economics and politics sit in the middle, binding Layer 3 motives to Layer 1 resources through Layer 2 social behaviour.
The rest of the paper applies the framework. Section 2 defines each layer in detail and marks their dependence relations. Section 3 analyses how different fields combine handles and why their toolkits differ. Section 4 walks through colour perception, clinical depression, and monetary inflation to show the map in action. Section 5 explains why current AI systems, lacking direct access to Layer 3, can imitate but not originate meaning. Section 6 extracts practical guidelines for research design and interdisciplinary dialogue. A brief conclusion gathers the pay‑offs and flags open questions.
