## 5  Toolkits for Making Claims Objective

The previous section established what each layer *is*. This section shows what each layer *gives* a researcher who wants to turn raw happenings into objective claims. Think of the toolkits below as three differently shaped handles that all must lift their evidence through the same Layer 4 gate.

| Source layer               | Main data formats                                              | Typical tools & protocols                                                                           | Built‑in strengths                                                           | Dominant error risks                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1 Physical foundation** | Numbers with units (kg, nm, s, A)                              | Precision instruments, controlled experiments, mathematical modelling, blind replication            | High quantifiability, strong cross‑observer agreement                        | Calibration drift, theory‑laden observation, scale limits (quantum, cosmic) |
| **L2 Living layer**        | Physiological traces, behavioural scores, comparative datasets | fMRI, EEG, lesion studies, reflex timing, hormone panels, cross‑species ethology                    | Connects structure to function; can pose causal interventions (drug, lesion) | Species‑specific bias, invasive‑method effects, ecological validity gaps    |
| **L3 Subjective stream**   | First‑person reports, qualitative descriptors, rating scales   | Phenomenological interviews, Likert inventories, psychophysics staircases, experience‑sampling apps | Direct access to felt qualities; captures valence and meaning                | Perspective bias, language distortion, demand characteristics               |

### 5.1 Layer‑specific toolkits in action

* **L1 example** Confirming the mass of the Higgs boson depends on calibrated calorimeters and statistical significance thresholds.
* **L2 example** Mapping the visual cortex uses fMRI patterns aligned with retinotopic stimuli, plus lesion follow‑ups when ethically possible.
* **L3 example** Characterising the flavour profile of a new coffee roast uses blinded tasting panels, each taster logging intensity and hedonic value on standard scales.

### 5.2 The single validation gate

Once evidence is harvested, every claim—particle mass, neural pathway, or tasting note—faces the same Layer 4 questions:

1. **Internal coherence** Does the claim contradict itself or the wider theory that houses it?
2. **Method transparency** Can another competent inquirer reproduce the procedure?
3. **Error accounting** Have calibration drift, species bias, or perspective bias been quantified or bounded?
4. **Public scrutiny** Has the claim survived peer review, replication attempts, or reflective‑equilibrium checks among diverse evaluators?

### 5.3 Translating errors into weights

Because the error profiles differ, the gate does not treat every handle equally. A tenth‑gram shift in an L1 mass reading can kill a physics paper; mild disagreement among tasters rarely sinks an aesthetics study. Formal weighting schemes—confidence intervals, effect sizes, robustness ratings—translate layer‑specific noise into a common currency of evidential force.

### 5.4 Why the system matters

Toolkits make clear why fields talk past one another. A physicist disciplined by calibration error may distrust introspective data; an ethicist disciplined by perspective bias may discount nanometre precision as irrelevant to lived value. Real progress begins when each side recognises that different handles carry different risks, yet all are judged by one gate.

In the next section we map entire disciplines onto the handles they rely on most, showing how mixed toolkits explain everything from the success of neuroscience to the chronic controversies of macro‑economics.
