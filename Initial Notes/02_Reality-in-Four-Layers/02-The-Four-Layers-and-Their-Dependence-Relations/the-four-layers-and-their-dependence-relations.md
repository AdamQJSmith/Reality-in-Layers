## 2  The Four Layers and Their Dependence Relations

This section sets out the four layers in precise terms, then shows how each depends on—and sometimes feeds back into—the others. The goal is to arm every later argument with a shared vocabulary.

| Layer                      | Ontological status                                           | Core properties                                              | Principal evidence handle                             | Typical limits                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1 Physical foundation** | Exists whether or not any life appears                       | Law‑governed, measurable, spatiotemporal                     | Instrument readings, repeatable observation           | Calibration error, theory‑laden measurement        |
| **L2 Living layer**        | Emergent from L1 structures, but introduces biological goals | Homeostasis, metabolism, sensory transduction, neural coding | Behavioural assays, physiology, imaging               | Species‑specific bias, invasive‑method constraints |
| **L3 Subjective stream**   | Emergent from L2 activity, irreducibly first‑person          | Qualitative feel, unity, temporal flow, valence              | First‑person reports, phenomenological comparison     | Perspective bias, verbal‑report limits             |
| **L4 Epistemic arena**     | Constructed by communities; abstract but publicly testable   | Language, logic, mathematics, norms, peer review             | Coherence checks, replication, reflective equilibrium | Paradigm lock‑in, sociocultural inertia            |

### 2.1 Layer 1 – Physical foundation

Particles, fields, and the forces that govern them make up the ontological floor. They behave according to regularities that are describable by mathematics and detectable, in principle, by any suitably equipped observer. No life or mind is needed for these entities to exist or interact.

### 2.2 Layer 2 – Living layer

Life reorganises Layer 1 matter into systems that maintain themselves, seek energy, and react adaptively. Within that broad biological platform, specialised sensory–neural circuits translate external events into coded signals. Those codes provide the raw material upon which consciousness can arise but are not themselves conscious.

### 2.3 Layer 3 – Subjective stream

When Layer 2 activity crosses a still‑unmapped threshold, it yields felt experience: the immediacy of colour, pain, desire, memory. These events are accessible only to the subject having them, yet people can compare notes and find overlap enough to justify talk of "shared experience."

### 2.4 Layer 4 – Epistemic arena

Here communities build languages, models, and norms, then test claims for logical coherence, predictive success, moral soundness, or other publicly stated standards. A model of gravity, a diagnostic manual, and Rawls's veil of ignorance are all Layer 4 artefacts.

### 2.5 Asymmetric dependence and feedback

* **Dependence** Each higher layer requires the structures below it: no neural codes without physical substrates; no experience without neural codes; no theory without experiencers.
* **Non‑reducibility** Higher‑layer properties cannot be exhaustively expressed in lower‑layer terms without loss (mass tells you nothing about the taste of coffee; spike trains do not reveal the hurt of grief).
* **Feedback** Causation is not one‑way. Layer 4 constructs reshape perception (microscopes extend vision), alter biology (medicine), and even re‑engineer the physical world (particle accelerators). Layer 3 intentions recruit Layer 2 muscles to move Layer 1 objects.

Understanding these relations prevents two common errors: reducing everything upward to pure concept or downward to raw physics. The next section shows how specific disciplines harvest evidence from one or more layers while submitting every finished claim to the common court of Layer 4.

Got it—the figure has to *earn its space* by adding a genuinely new piece of information, not just restate the paragraph in boxes. Below is a streamlined concept that keeps the familiar vertical stack **and** adds the single extra idea the prose has introduced but not yet pictured:

*each layer brings in a different "evidence handle," yet every claim must cross the same validation gate in Layer 4.*

### Evolution Note (Added [Current Date])
Building on the layer definitions and dependence relations here:
- The distinction between Layer 2 (living/biological, including sensory mechanisms) and Layer 3 (subjective experience) should remain until consciousness is fully reducible to biology. Layer 2's sensory mechanisms enable, constrain, and determine the nature of Layer 3 experiences, but the focus is on practical evidence handles for objectivity in Layer 4, not on resolving emergence mechanisms.
- This avoids dualism by grounding Layer 3 causally in Layer 2's biology, with no evidence for consciousness persisting independently or arising elsewhere.
- Future updates could note that this distinction is contingent on scientific progress; if reduction occurs, Layers 2 and 3 might merge for evidential purposes.
