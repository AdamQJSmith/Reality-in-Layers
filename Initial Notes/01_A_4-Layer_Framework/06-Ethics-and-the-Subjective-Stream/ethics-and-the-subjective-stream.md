# 6. Ethics and the Subjective Stream
Ethics deserves special attention in this framework because it illustrates how disciplines can be grounded in different layers while still making legitimate claims to objectivity.
## 6.1 The Grounding of Ethics in Layer 3
Ethics is primarily grounded in the Subjective Stream (Layer 3). Ethical questions concern how we should act, what kind of people we should be, and how we should organize our societies. These questions are fundamentally about the well-being, rights, and dignity of conscious beings—matters that are directly related to the Subjective Stream.

Consider the ethical principle that we should not cause unnecessary suffering. This principle is grounded in the recognition that suffering is a conscious experience with a negative qualitative character. Without the Subjective Stream—without the what-it-is-like-ness of pain and suffering—this ethical principle would have no foundation.

Similarly, concepts like autonomy, dignity, and rights are grounded in the recognition of other beings as subjects of their own experiences, with their own first-personal perspectives on the world. These ethical concepts reference the Subjective Stream in a way that concepts in physics or chemistry do not.
## 6.2 The Irreducibility of Ethics to Layer 2
While ethics is grounded in the Subjective Stream, it cannot be reduced to the Perceptual Filter (Layer 2). Evolutionary psychology and neuroscience can help explain why we have certain moral intuitions or emotions, but they cannot resolve normative ethical questions.

For example, evolutionary psychology might explain why humans have evolved a sense of fairness or reciprocity, but it cannot tell us whether a particular distribution of resources is just. Neuroscience might identify the brain regions activated when we make moral judgments, but it cannot tell us whether those judgments are correct.
### 6.2.1 Why Ethics Can't Be Reduced to Biology
Ethical questions cannot be answered solely by pointing to evolutionary advantages or neural mechanisms. Even if we fully understood the biological basis of moral intuitions, we would still face the normative question of whether we should act on those intuitions.

For instance, humans may have evolved tendencies toward both cooperation and competition, both empathy and aggression. Biology can explain these tendencies but cannot tell us which we should cultivate or when each is appropriate. The "is" of biological explanation does not determine the "ought" of ethical prescription.

Similarly, understanding the neural correlates of moral judgment doesn't resolve moral disagreements. If two people have different moral intuitions about a situation, knowing the brain states associated with those intuitions doesn't tell us whose intuition is more reliable or whose judgment we should accept.

Ethics requires engagement with Layer 3 in ways that other knowledge forms don't because it directly concerns the experiences, interests, and relationships of conscious beings. While informed by biology, ethics cannot be reduced to it without losing its normative dimension.
## 6.3 The Distinctive Objectivity of Ethics
Because ethics is grounded in the Subjective Stream rather than the Physical Foundation, its claims to objectivity take a different form than those of physics or chemistry. Ethical objectivity is not based on correspondence to mind-independent physical reality but on coherence, comprehensiveness, and reflective stability in addressing normative questions.

An ethical theory can be considered objective to the extent that it provides a coherent, comprehensive, and reflectively stable framework for understanding and guiding human action. This form of objectivity differs from that of the natural sciences but is no less legitimate within its domain.
### 6.3.1 Ethics Isn't "Less Objective" But References Different Layers
It's crucial to understand that ethics isn't "less objective" than physics; it establishes objectivity through a different pathway that references different layers. The methodological differences between ethics and physics reflect their different reference points, not a hierarchy of objectivity.

Physics establishes objectivity through correspondence with Layer 1, accessed through Layer 2. When physicists develop equations describing electromagnetic fields, they're creating Layer 4 constructs that model patterns in Layer 1.

Ethics establishes objectivity through coherence, comprehensiveness, and reflective stability in addressing normative questions that arise from Layer 3. When ethicists develop theories of justice, they're creating Layer 4 constructs that systematize normative intuitions from Layer 3.

In both cases, the framework, arguments, and methodologies exist in Layer 4. The differences lie in which other layers they reference and how they validate their claims. This perspective helps us understand why different disciplines use different methods without requiring us to rank them hierarchically.
