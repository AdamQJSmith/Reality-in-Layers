# 2. What is an Ontological Layer?
Before exploring each layer in detail, let's clarify what constitutes an "ontological layer" in this framework. An ontological layer represents a domain of reality with:

Distinctive properties that cannot be fully captured in terms of other layers
A specific mode of existence or being
Particular relations of dependence with other layers
Characteristic ways of being known or investigated

These layers form a hierarchical structure with asymmetric dependence relations. Higher layers depend on lower layers for their existence, while introducing novel properties and relations not present in the lower layers. This dependence is not merely conceptual but ontologicalâ€”the later layers could not exist without the lower ones, though they cannot be reduced to them without remainder.

It's important to note that concepts like "objectivity" and "subjectivity" themselves are not inherent properties of any particular layer. Rather, they are conceptual tools that emerge in Layer 4 (Epistemic Constructs). These concepts don't "exist" independently in Layers 1, 2, or 3; they arise only when a knowing subject (or community of subjects) in Layer 4 sets standards, builds methodologies, and applies these to data from the other layers. This distinction is crucial for understanding how different disciplines establish their claims to knowledge and objectivity.
