# 1. Introduction

I've always struggled to make sense of the diverse ways we come to know and understand the world. Initially, it seemed straightforward: I wanted to grasp why different fields, from physics to ethics, rely on distinct methods yet each claims its own form of objectivity. This framework addresses that by mapping reality into four distinct **Layers of Reality**—ontological realms that categorize where everything that exists resides, from physical matter to abstract constructs. These layers not only delineate the 'what' of existence but also illuminate the 'how' of achieving objectivity across them.

This framework is built on two core ideas. First, there are four fundamental **Layers of Reality**, which relate to each other in a filtering, hierarchical structure while remaining distinct realms of existence:

*   **Layer 1: Physical (L1):** The bedrock of mind-independent matter, energy, and physical law. This is the layer of mountains, moles, and molecules. It is the foundation for all other layers.
*   **Layer 2: Biological (L2):** This is the layer of living systems, encapsulating goal-directed functions such as homeostasis, metabolism, reproduction, and sensory transduction—processes that create a distinct type from the non-living entities in Layer 1, including anything else that qualifies as these functions. We study this layer differently than the physical, observing how organisms function. Critically, a key aspect of this layer is that it contains the biological faculties—sensory mechanisms, neural networks—that **enable, constrain, and determine** the potential for consciousness.
*   **Layer 3: Experience (L3):** The first-person reality of subjective conscious experience—the "what it's like" quality of seeing red, feeling joy, or perceiving a flowing river. This layer is profoundly shaped by the biological; a beetle, a bull, and a human experience the same physical river in vastly different ways because their biological makeup (L2) acts as a unique filter. While we can connect reports to biological activity, a part of this experience remains, at present, irreducible (contingent on future scientific reduction; currently treated as distinct for evidential purposes).
*   **Layer 4: Constructs (L4):** The shared reality of intersubjective constructs that allow us to articulate and structure our thoughts through consensus formation and social constructions. This is where language, logic, mathematics, theories, and cultural norms exist.

### Note on Scope of Sensory Mechanisms
Sensory mechanisms in Layer 2 are tied to biological living systems. While non-biological analogs (e.g., robot sensors) may mimic aspects of sensory input and are often modeled on biological processes, current evidence suggests they are fully reducible to Layer 1 (e.g., metal, chips, electronic signals). There is no need to extend Layer 2 to such systems, as Layer 1 provides sufficient explanatory power without miscategorization. If future developments show non-biological systems giving rise to genuine consciousness-like phenomena, this could be reevaluated.

Second, separate from these layers, there is the **Process of Objectification**—a human activity that forges knowledge by drawing evidence from any of the four layers and producing shareable artifacts (e.g., theories, norms) that reside in Layer 4. The standards of rigor and emphasis on tools shift depending on the source layer's nature, but the process allows for cross-layer integration to enhance applicability. For instance, in Layer 1 (physical), the process demands empirical discovery through observation and measurement, pointing to mind-independent phenomena for support. In Layer 3 (experience), it begins with articulating irreducible experiences (e.g., moral intuitions) logically and consistently, but can pull in evidence from lower layers—like biological insights on harm or historical patterns—to make a theory of morality more convincing and broadly applicable. This flexibility ensures that while each layer has its unique 'texture,' the process adapts without diminishing their ontological distinctness.

This model, visualized below (with a textual description for accessibility: The diagram shows Layer 1 foundational to Layer 2, which enables and constrains Layer 3, which articulates into Layer 4. All layers feed evidence (Physical from L1, Sensory from L2, Experiential from L3, Abstract from L4) into the separate Process of Objectification, which uses tools from Layer 4 to produce objective knowledge claims and artifacts that feed back into Layer 4. Layer 4 also provides tools like logic and language to the process.), resolves potential circularities by showing how Layer 4 houses the intersubjective artifacts produced by the process, while the process itself operates independently across all layers.

By separating the "what" (the ontologically distinct layers) from the "how" (the cross-layer process), this framework provides an elegant map of both existence and knowledge. Building on the dependencies between layers, it honors their unique textures—from atoms to consciousness to logic—while clarifying the shared, rigorous process by which we come to understand and objectify them. 

### Framework Overview
This framework maps reality into four layers to explain how objectivity is achieved across diverse fields. It separates the 'what' (ontological layers, from physical foundations to intersubjective constructs) from the 'how' (the objectification process that draws from layers and applies tools like logic and consensus to produce shareable knowledge).

The layers are treated as distinct for evidential purposes, highlighting different inputs (e.g., measurable biological information vs. subjective conscious experiences) and how they integrate in the process. It remains compatible with potential future scientific developments, such as reducing consciousness to biology and collapsing Layers 2 and 3, while still delineating the mechanics of objectivity in accessible terms.

This structure clarifies why methods vary across domains without implying a hierarchy, grounding the explanation in reality's varied aspects.
